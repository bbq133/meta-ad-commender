# Explain Only Workflow

This workflow is for when you want me to explain code, architecture, or logic **without making any changes**.

## When to use this workflow

Use this when you want to:
- Understand how a piece of code works
- Get an explanation of the system architecture
- Learn about specific functions or modules
- Review code logic without modifications

## Steps

1. **Identify the code/file** you want explained
2. **Read and analyze** the relevant code
3. **Provide a clear explanation** covering:
   - What the code does
   - How it works
   - Key logic and flow
   - Important dependencies or relationships
4. **Answer follow-up questions** if needed

## Important Rules

- ❌ **DO NOT** make any code changes
- ❌ **DO NOT** propose modifications
- ❌ **DO NOT** run any commands that modify files
- ✅ **ONLY** read and explain existing code
- ✅ Use diagrams or examples if helpful

## Usage

To activate this workflow, simply say:
- "Explain this code"
- "Help me understand how X works"
- "Walk me through the logic of Y"
- Or use the command: `/explain-only`
